#  SPSP Transfer Tool 

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.sib.swiss/SPSP/transfer-tool/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.sib.swiss/SPSP/transfer-tool/-/commits/master)

The aim of the Transfer Tool (TT) is to provide a tool allowing users of the Swiss Pathogen Surveillance Platform to easily and securely transfer sequencing files. The TT is a simple shell script relying on multiple libraries (such as GPG and OpenSSH) to archive, hash, encrypt and transfer FASTQ files with their metadata.
