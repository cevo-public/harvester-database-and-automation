test_plate_mapping		"A mapping between test_metadata, extraction_plate and sequencing_plate"
test_plate_mapping	test_id	As defined in test_metadata
test_plate_mapping	old_sample	"A sample that left Viollier before 07 June 2021 is considered as old. We have some wrong mappings in the old data: for example, we have multiple tests mapped to the same plate and well. For the new data (i.e., old_sample=false), we will prevent this by enforcing a uniqueness of plate-well combinations in this table."
test_plate_mapping	extraction_plate	As defined in extraction_plate
test_plate_mapping	extraction_plate_well	The well position on the extraction plate
test_plate_mapping	extraction_e_gene_ct	"As of 11.06.2021 Viollier only provides a single CT value, which is written into this column."
test_plate_mapping	extraction_rdrp_gene_ct	The RdRp gene CT
test_plate_mapping	sequencing_plate	As defined in sequencing_plate
test_plate_mapping	sequencing_plate_well	The well position on the sequencing plate

consensus_sequence	sample_name	Name given to the sequenced material (ultimately assigned by the sequencing center)
consensus_sequence	sequencing_plate	As defined in sequencing_plate
consensus_sequence	sequencing_plate_well	The well position on the sequencing plate
